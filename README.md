**The game was created to order, with special conditions.
I will tell you about the controls in the game and what happens in it:
You can change the size of the circle using the mouse wheel, change the colors of the circle if you press the right mouse button

There are 6 colors for the circle and background (for each).
The game stretches to the entire screen, and to exit you need to press the ESC key.**
